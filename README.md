Analysis of Seattle Airbnb data

Motivation for the project: Provide and share insights from Airbnb data.

According to Investopedia, Airbnb is an online marketplace that connects people who want to rent out their homes with people who are looking for accommodations in that locale. It currently covers more than 100,000 cities and 220 countries worldwide.

Using data that they provided, I analyzed the demand for rental units by time of year, rental prices by neighborhood, and created linear regression model that predicts prices.


Libraries used: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, descartes, geopandas, shapely, fiona, sklearn
(very useful guide to installing geopandas: https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/fastest-way-to-install-geopandas-in-jupyter-notebook-on-windows-8f734e11fa2b)

Files used: calendar.csv, listings.csv, reviews.csv; downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle/data

Summary of the results of the analysis: Summer months are most popular time to visit Seattle, central neighborhoods (in particular Southeast Magnolia and Portage Bay) are more expensive on average. Linear regression model describes about 60% of the variability of the price.
