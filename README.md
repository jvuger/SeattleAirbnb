# SeattleAirbnb
Analysis of and price prediction using Seattle Airbnb data.
## Introduction

According to Investopedia, Airbnb is an online marketplace that connects people who want to rent out their homes with people who are looking for accommodations in that locale. It currently covers more than 100,000 cities and 220 countries worldwide.

In this project, my goal was to provide and share insights from Airbnb data, by answering the following questions:
1. What are the busiest times of year to visit Seattle?

2. What is the average Airbnb rental property price by neighbourhood?

3. Can we predict listing prices using linear regression?
 
## Technologies
* Python 3.7.2

Libraries used: 
* pandas
* numpy
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* descartes
* shapely
* fiona
* sklearn 
* geopandas 



## Summary of the results
Summer months are most popular time to visit Seattle.

Central neighborhoods (in particular Southeast Magnolia and Portage Bay) are more expensive on average.

Linear regression model that was developed describes about 60% of the variability of the price.
